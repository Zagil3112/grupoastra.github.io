<div class="content">
    <p>The city of Medellin has emerged as a leading industrial hub in Colombia during its history and has shown the
        resilience of its people through difficult times. Proud of its scars, revived by its culture, and sustained by
        its entreprenurial spirit, Medellin is the city host of this event, impressing the spirit of a region that now
        goes forward aiming to new heights.</p>
    <p><b>CICTA</b> will cover the work of the network of science & technology development within the region and beyond,
        focusing on the progress towards the linkage with the International Aerospace Industry, looking for present and
        future synergies around the globe. This edition will be under responsibility of Universidad de Antioquia through
        its Aerospace Engineering Program. More than 400 participants, national and international, are expected, based
        on previous editions, combining members of academia, industry and government institutions.</p>
    <p>The <i>International Congress of Aerospace Science & Technology</i> (<b>CICTA</b>) will take place for its
        <b>10th edition</b> during <b>November 6-8, 2024</b> at the city of <b>Medellin, Colombia</b>.
    </p>
    <p>During the last decade, Colombia has been pushing forward towards the development of its Aerospace Sector looking
        for the establishment of a solid academic and industrial base beyond the traditional segments related to Air
        Transport Operations, Maintenance and Repair Operations, Air Traffic Management and post-life market. </p>
    <p>Now, the focus is set on a Knowledge Based Economy, reaching for segments linked to early stages in the supply
        chain and development cycle of Aerospace Products and services. Data processing, software development and
        exploitation of Artificial intelligence are not only considered but embedded into the Aerospace domain, leaving
        the clear connection to Cyber-security.</p>
    <p>The energy migration is a key focus along with new aircraft operations concepts and architecture within the
        urban air mobility ecosystem and the related re-conception of critical systems, digital engineering and system
        development methodologies. Space access, space systems and missions developments, space sustainability and human
        factors are some of the main drivers of this edition of CICTA. </p>
    <p>This edition will be under responsibility of Universidad de Antioquia through its Aerospace Engineering Program.
        More than 400 participants, national and international, are expected, based on previous editions, combining
        members of academia, industry and government institutions.</p>
